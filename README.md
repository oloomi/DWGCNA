# DWGCNA
Differential Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis is a network-based approach that we have developed for finding candidate disease genes by comparing case and control gene coexpression networks. DWGCNA enables finding genes that their expression level is not changed between two stages, however, their interaction with other genes has changed. These genes are not found in routine differential expression analysis.

To learn more about GCNs, please have a look at the Wikipedia page created by me! :-)
